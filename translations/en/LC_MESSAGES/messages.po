"        <br/> Cause of disease:\n"
"\n"
"        <br/><br/>Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae)"
" is a fungal disease that depends on two species to spread and develop. "
"It spends a portion of its two-year life cycle on Eastern red cedar "
"(Juniperus virginiana). The pathogen’s spores develop in late fall on the"
" juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.\n"
"        \n"
"        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>\n"
"        <br/>1. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that"
" infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t"
" too many of them.\n"
"\n"
"        <br/>2. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones "
"that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.\n"

"        <br/> Cause of disease:\n"
"\n"
"        <br/><br/>Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder "
"photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain "
"fill. The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be "
"estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to "
"grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress "
"past the ear leaf around pollination time.\tBecause a decrease in "

"\n"
"        <br/><br/>Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi,"
" is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of "
"corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio "
"field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern "
"half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions "
"favor the development and spread of rust fungus\n"
"        \n"
"        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>\n"
"        <br/>1. Although rust is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very "
"rarely has there been a need for fungicide applications. This is due to "
"the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and"
" most possess some degree of resistance.\n"
"        \n"
"        <br/>2. However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible."
" In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior "
"to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early "
"fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. "
"Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. "

"        <br/>1. Management of NCLB can be achieved primarily by using "

" <b>Crop</b>: Grape <br/>Disease: Black Rot<br/>\n"
"        <br/> Cause of disease:\n"
"\n"
"        <br/><br/> 1. The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, "
"tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified "
"berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines "
"become the major infection source the following spring.\n"
"        \n"
"        <br/> 2. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot "
"out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by "
"air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, "
"these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the "
"leaves and fruit stems. \n"
"        <br/> 3. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When "
"the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer "
"providing continuous infection.\n"
"        \n"
"        \n"
"        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>\n"
"        <br/>1. Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the"
" vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the "
"vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the "
"amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.\n"
"        \n"
"        <br/>2. Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of "
"weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity "
"and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.\n"
"        \n"
"        <br/>3. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to"
" protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, "
"mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as "
"new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 "
"inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has "
"set."

"        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>\n"
"        <br/>1. Post-infection practices (sanitation and vine surgery) "

"        \n"
"        <br/>2. Sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In "

"there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by "
"cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to "
"where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the "

"        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:\n"
"\n"
"        <br/><br/>1. <i>Loosen the soil</i> deeply with a shovel, and "
"water thoroughly to dissolve water-soluble potassium. Allow the soil to "
"fully dry, and repeat digging and watering the soil two or three more "
"times.\n"
"\n"
"        <br/>2. <i>Sift through the soil</i>, and remove as many rocks as"
" possible, using a soil sifter. Minerals occurring in rocks such as mica "
"and feldspar slowly release potassium into the soil slowly through "
"weathering.\n"
"\n"
"        <br/>3. Stop applying potassium-rich commercial fertilizer. Apply"
" only commercial fertilizer that has a '0' in the final number field. "
"Commercial fertilizers use a three number system for measuring levels of "
"nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. The last number stands for "
"potassium. Another option is to stop using commercial fertilizers all "
"together and to begin using only organic matter to enrich the soil.\n"
"\n"
"        <br/>4. Mix crushed eggshells, crushed seashells, wood ash or "
"soft rock phosphate to the soil to add calcium. Mix in up to 10 percent "
"of organic compost to help amend and balance the soil.\n"
"\n"
"        <br/>5. Use NPK fertilizers with low K levels and organic "
"fertilizers since they have low NPK values.\n"
"\n"
"        <br/>6. Grow a cover crop of legumes that will fix nitrogen in "
"the soil. This practice will meet the soil’s needs for nitrogen without "
"increasing phosphorus or potassium.\n"
